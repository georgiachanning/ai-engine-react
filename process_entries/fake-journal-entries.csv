"May 15, 2017","Dear Diary,
Another late night in the engineering lab. The fluorescent lights are making my eyes hurt, but I can't stop thinking about Professor Chen's question from today's Advanced Materials class: ""What kind of mark do you want to leave on the world?""
Back home in Shenzhen, the path was always clear - study hard, get good grades, make my parents proud. But here in America, everyone keeps asking about passion, about dreams. My classmates talk about startups and changing the world, while I'm still trying to figure out if I'm even allowed to dream that big.
Lisa from my study group introduced me to her friend Michael today. He's doing his PhD in Computer Science, and the way he talked about his research - his eyes lit up like the Shanghai skyline at night. I wonder if I'll ever feel that way about anything. Everyone else seems so certain about what they want.
Sometimes I think about what Mama said before I left China: ""Focus on your studies first, relationships can wait."" But I see couples walking across campus, holding hands, sharing bubble tea, and I feel this emptiness. Am I missing out? Or is she right - should I pour everything into my career right now?
My roommate says I need to ""put myself out there more,"" whatever that means. But between classes, lab work, and trying to improve my English, I barely have time to sleep. And dating in America seems so... complicated. Different rules, different expectations. At least in the lab, equations make sense. People are much messier.
It's almost 1 AM. The security guard just did his rounds and gave me that look again - the one that says ""go home, kid."" Maybe he's right.
Tomorrow is another day of questions without answers.

Dear Diary,

I can't stop smiling like an idiot while writing this. Sarah. Even writing her name makes my heart do this weird flutter thing. We were both reaching for the same circuit board in the robotics lab last month, and now... how is it possible that so much can change in just a few weeks?

She's brilliant - her thesis on automated manufacturing systems is genuinely revolutionary. But it's not just that. Yesterday, we were debugging code together until 3 AM, and she made this horrible pun about binary trees that made me laugh so hard I spilled my coffee. She didn't even flinch when I made a mess - just helped me clean up while making even worse computer science jokes.

It's different with her. I don't feel like I have to pretend to be more ""American"" or hide my accent. She actually asks me about China, about my family, about what it was like growing up in Shenzhen. And when I stumble over words in English, she just waits patiently, never making me feel self-conscious.

Last night, we were talking about our plans after graduation. I told her about the job offers I'm considering in Silicon Valley, and instead of being put off by my ambitions (like some others have been), her eyes lit up. She's applying for positions there too. The possibility of building a future together... I know it's too soon to think about that, but I can't help it.

Mama would probably say I'm getting ahead of myself. ""Focus on your finals,"" she'd tell me. But for the first time, I feel like maybe I don't have to choose between career and love. Sarah understands the late nights, the dedication, the drive - because she has it too.

I'm taking her to that new hot pot place tomorrow. She's never had it before, and I'm a little nervous. What if it's too spicy? What if she hates it? But then I remember how she tried to learn to say ""hello"" in Mandarin just to surprise me, and I think maybe, just maybe, this could be something really special.

Is this what they mean when they say ""when you know, you know""?

我真的很喜欢她 (I really like her)

Ming
P.S. Need to remember to fix that bug in our joint project before Tuesday's presentation. Even if her smile is very distracting.

"April 15, 2019","Dear Diary,
3 AM again. The city that never sleeps. From my window on the 32nd floor, I can see the Williamsburg Bridge lit up against the darkness - one of Moses's lesser works, according to Caro. Sarah's asleep in the bedroom; she has an early meeting tomorrow at her consulting firm.
This book has gotten under my skin in a way I didn't expect. Moses began as an idealist, didn't he? The swimming pools, the parks, the grand vision of public works. But power corrupted him so gradually he didn't even notice. Like a frog in slowly boiling water. How many lives did he destroy in the name of ""progress""?
It makes me think about my own work. Today I optimized an algorithm that will make the firm millions, maybe billions over time. But what am I really building? Moses at least left physical structures - bridges, highways, parks. My code just moves money from one place to another, faster than anyone else. Is this what I dreamed of when I left China?
Sarah and I talked about this over dinner. She thinks I'm being too hard on myself, says that markets need liquidity, that what we do has value. She's probably right. But I can't shake this feeling that there's something bigger I should be reaching for. Back in Shenzhen, I saw entire cities rise from nothing in a decade. Here, they can't even fix the subway on time.
Maybe that's what fascinates me about Moses - the sheer scale of his ambition. In China, this kind of massive state-directed change is normal. Here, it seems impossible now. Would I have been different in his position? Would any of us?
Sarah stirred just now, called out for me. ""Come to bed, 宝贝 (baobei)."" She's been practicing her Mandarin. Even half-asleep, she makes me feel less alone in this glass and steel forest.
But I'm not ready for sleep yet. The questions keep coming: What does it mean to do good in the world? Is it enough to succeed personally, to take care of those close to us? Or do we owe something more to the society that hosts us?
Moses thought he knew the answers. I'm less and less sure.
The bridge is still glowing. Thousands of lives crossing between boroughs, following paths laid down by a man whose name they probably don't know. What paths am I laying down? What will they lead to?

Ming

P.S. Need to call Mama tomorrow. She'll worry if I don't update her about the bonus news.",
"July 23, 2019","Dear Diary,
I woke up at 4 AM, drenched in sweat, the dream still clinging to me like Shanghai humidity. Sarah asked what was wrong, but I couldn't explain. How do you describe a dream where your mother turns into a dragon while making dumplings in your Manhattan kitchen?
In the dream, Mama was teaching Sarah how to fold the perfect jiǎozi, just like she promised she would when she visits next month. Her hands moved with that familiar precision, each fold exact, while Sarah struggled to copy her. But every time Sarah made a mistake, Mama would grow slightly larger, more serpentine. Her criticisms came out as smoke.
The strange part wasn't the transformation - it was how normal it felt in the dream. Sarah kept trying, her fingers getting clumsier as Mama's shadow grew longer across the kitchen floor. I wanted to intervene, to say something, but I was frozen in place. Classic dream paralysis, I suppose.
The worst part came when Sarah finally made a perfect dumpling. Instead of praise, Mama fully transformed into this massive, beautiful, terrifying dragon. She looked at Sarah and said in perfect English, ""Now you can feed my son. But will you know how to love him properly? Like a Chinese mother would?""
I woke up right then, my heart pounding.
Dr. Zhang, my old therapist from college, would have a field day with this one. The anxiety about Mama's first visit to meet Sarah, my worlds colliding, the food as a symbol of cultural transmission... it's all so obvious it's almost embarrassing.
Sarah's been studying Mandarin for months now, learning to cook Chinese dishes, even reading about Chinese history. She tries so hard. Sometimes I think she makes more effort to bridge our cultural gap than I do. And yet... and yet I still have these dreams where I fear it won't be enough for Mama.
是不是我太过分了? (Am I being too much?)
The sun is rising now over the East River. Sarah's still sleeping, making that tiny whistle sound she makes when she's really tired. Looking at her, I feel ashamed of my subconscious fears. She's more than enough. She's everything.
But I can't shake Mama's dragon-voice asking that question: ""Will you know how to love him properly?""
As if love could be proper. As if it follows rules.
I should try to sleep again. Big presentation tomorrow about the new trading algorithm. But first, I'm going to write down the recipe for Mama's dumplings. Just in case the dragon knows something I don't.

Ming

P.S. Need to confirm Mama's flight details and make sure the guest room is perfect. No dragons allowed.",
"December 25, 2019","Dear Diary,
My heart feels so full tonight I can barely contain it. The apartment still smells like the blend of Mama's red-braised pork and Sarah's attempted apple pie (slightly burned, but made with so much love). Baba is snoring softly on the couch, still wearing the ridiculous Santa hat Sarah bought him, while Mama keeps trying to force leftovers on everyone even though we're all stuffed.
I caught a moment today that I want to remember forever: Mama was teaching Sarah how to use chopsticks properly (yes, after two years, she still struggles sometimes), and Baba was watching them with this soft smile I've rarely seen. Then Mama said something in Mandarin about Sarah being ""我们的女儿"" (our daughter), thinking Sarah wouldn't understand. But Sarah did understand - her Mandarin has gotten so good - and she started crying happy tears. Then everyone was crying and hugging, even Baba, who never cries.
Earlier today, while the women were cooking, Baba pulled me aside onto the balcony. Through the glass, we could see Mama showing Sarah her secret dumpling technique (the real one this time, not the simplified version she shows everyone else). Baba put his hand on my shoulder and said, ""儿子, you have chosen well. She has a good heart."" Coming from him, a man of few words, this felt monumental.
I've been carrying the ring in my jacket pocket for two weeks now. It's burning a hole there, but the moment hasn't felt right yet. Or maybe I've just been nervous. But watching our families blend so naturally today, seeing how Sarah handles my parents' quirks with such grace and genuine interest... I think I'll ask her on New Year's Eve. Under the fireworks. Too cliché? Maybe. But she loves that romantic stuff.
Found myself thinking about my grandfather today, wish he could have met Sarah. He always said, ""家和万事兴"" - when the family is harmonious, everything prospers. Looking around at our little multicultural Christmas celebration, I finally understand what he meant.
Mama just came in to ask if we need more food (for the fifth time). Sarah answered in Mandarin, making Mama beam with pride. They're planning our Lunar New Year menu together already. My worlds aren't colliding anymore - they're merging, creating something new and beautiful.
Tonight, as we played mahjong (Sarah is getting dangerously good), I looked around the table and saw my past and future sitting there together, laughing, sharing, belonging. The life I dreamed about when I first came to America as a scared college student... it's happening. It's real.
I think I hear Sarah coming. She's probably wondering why I'm writing instead of helping clean up. Better go before Mama drafts me into washing dishes duty.
家. Home. Finally.

Ming

P.S. Need to practice my proposal speech. And maybe check the weather forecast for New Year's Eve. And make sure the ring is the right size. And...",

Dear Diary,

Another late night ""emergency"" with Sarah's database migration project. Three hours of me explaining SQL optimization while she grew increasingly frustrated. I thought I was helping, but when I suggested a clear step-by-step solution, she just shut her laptop and said she needed to be alone. I don't understand - if there's a problem, and I can fix it, why isn't that making things better?

The ring is still in my sock drawer. The New Year's plan fell through because she had to work late, and now... the timing just doesn't feel right. She comes home exhausted every night, dark circles under her eyes. This new fintech startup is demanding so much from her. Yesterday, she burst into tears over a missing semicolon in her code. I immediately showed her where it was, but somehow that made her cry harder.

Sometimes I miss the easy rhythm we had before, when we'd spend weekends working on random coding projects together, laughing at our bugs. Now when I suggest we do that, she says she can't look at another screen. I get it - her job is intense. But I feel like I'm failing her somehow. Like there's a script I'm supposed to follow but can't read.

Mama called today, asking about wedding plans (subtle as always). I changed the subject. How can I explain that my brilliant, capable girlfriend seems to be unraveling, and I don't know how to help? All my analytical skills, my problem-solving abilities - they feel useless right now.

Last night, I made her favorite Sichuan dishes, thinking it would cheer her up. While we ate, I started breaking down different career strategies she could consider, maybe ways to optimize her workflow. She just pushed her food around the plate and said, ""Can we just eat? Not everything needs a solution.""

But doesn't it? Isn't that what I'm good at - finding solutions? If I can't fix this for her, what good am I?

The city feels different lately too. People are talking about some virus in China. Mama's been calling more frequently, asking if we have masks. Sarah says I'm being paranoid when I suggest we stock up on supplies. Maybe she's right. I just wish I knew how to make everything okay for her.

I keep thinking about what Professor Chen used to say about engineering problems versus human problems. ""Not everything that's broken needs to be fixed immediately. Sometimes things just need time and space to find their own equilibrium."" I didn't understand then. Still not sure I do now.

Sarah's crying in the shower again. I can hear it through the wall. My first instinct is to go in, to try to help, to solve. But maybe... maybe that's not what she needs right now.

I'll wait. I'm good at optimizing systems, but maybe this isn't a system that needs optimization. Maybe it's just a human being who needs... what? That's the variable I can't seem to solve for.

- Ming

P.S. The ring box is collecting dust. For now, that's okay. It needs to be the right moment. Everything needs to be perfect. I can wait.

Dear Diary,

Baba's oxygen levels dropped again today. The hospital in Shenzhen only allows WeChat video calls for 5 minutes each day. His face on the screen was so pale, the oxygen mask making him look small and fragile. This isn't the strong father I know, the man who carried me on his shoulders through Lianhuashan Park, who taught me to always stand straight and face challenges head-on.

The helplessness is unbearable. Sarah found me at 3 AM last night, sitting in the dark, staring at my phone, waiting for updates from Mama. She made me some hot chrysanthemum tea, just like Mama used to. Her pronunciation of ""菊花茶"" is getting better, but all I could think was - will I ever hear Baba correct her tones again?

Our apartment feels like a fortress and a prison at once. The sirens outside never stop. From our window, I can see the empty streets of Manhattan, occasional masked figures scurrying like ghosts between buildings. The city feels like a sci-fi movie, or maybe like those post-apocalyptic games I used to play. Except this is real. All too real.

Sarah's company announced permanent work-from-home today. We converted the guest room into a second office, and now we orbit each other in this small space, both trapped in our separate Zoom meetings. Sometimes I hear her laughing at something her coworkers said, and it feels surreal - how can anyone laugh when Baba is fighting for breath 7,000 miles away?

I know I'm being unfair. Sarah's been incredible through all this. She learned how to make congee yesterday, wanting to comfort me with familiar food. It wasn't quite right - too watery, not enough ginger - but the gesture made me cry. First time I've cried since this started. She held me and didn't try to fix anything. Maybe she understands something about comfort that I'm still learning.

The doctors say the next 48 hours are critical. I keep doing the mental math - if I left now (impossible with travel bans), how long would it take to reach Shenzhen? Would I even be allowed into the hospital? Would I just put more people at risk?

Numbers used to make me feel better. Data, probabilities, statistics. But now they terrify me. I can't stop checking infection rates, mortality rates, trying to calculate Baba's chances. Sarah caught me making spreadsheets of survival statistics at 4 AM and gently closed my laptop. ""Sometimes numbers lie,"" she said. I want to believe her.

Mama's being so strong, handling everything alone. She says she's fine, but I can hear the exhaustion in her voice. This morning she said, ""At least I know you're safe there with Sarah."" The guilt of not being there is crushing. What kind of son am I, hiding in New York while my parents face this alone?

The sun is setting now. Another day of waiting, of WhatsApp messages and WeChat calls. Of holding our breath, literally and figuratively. Sarah's ordering groceries online. Life continues, somehow.

请保佑爸爸 (Please protect Father)

- Ming

P.S. Need to remember to eat. Sarah keeps leaving snacks by my laptop. Small acts of love in the time of COVID.

How long has it been? The pages feel stiff, unused. Found this journal while unpacking yet another box (will we ever be fully moved in?). Felt compelled to write something, watching the fog roll over Twin Peaks from our new apartment.

A poem came to mind:

Bay winds scatter cherry blossoms
Like pink snow on streets that
Never knew winter
While fog embraces the bridge
Like a mother's careful hands

Sarah would tease me for being so sentimental. ""My pragmatic engineer, secretly a poet?"" But she's at a conference in Seattle this week, so I can indulge my private thoughts.

The ring on my finger still feels new, though we've been engaged for eight months now. Sometimes I catch myself staring at it while coding, remembering how I finally proposed - not with fireworks or grand gestures, but on a random Tuesday morning over burnt toast and coffee, because in that moment, watching her debug code in her pajamas, hair a mess, completely focused... I couldn't wait another second.

Spring in San Francisco is different from New York. More subtle. Like the city itself - all microclimates and hidden staircases. The research lab feels right too. Less pressure than trading, more purpose. Building something that might matter.

但是我还是想念纽约的春天

Dear Diary,

3:42 AM and I can't sleep. That edge case in the transformer architecture keeps nagging at me. What if we're thinking about attention all wrong? Everyone's focused on the positional encoding, but what if the real problem is that we're treating time as a linear dimension?

Quick thought experiment:
Imagine each attention head as a fractal structure, where temporal relationships aren't just forward/backward, but nested like Russian dolls. Each token could attend not just to its neighbors, but to structurally similar patterns across different time scales. Like how Mandarin speakers understand tonal patterns - it's not just about the sequence, but about the hierarchical relationships.

Drew this out on a napkin at dinner (Sarah rolled her eyes - ""No ML diagrams at nice restaurants, remember?""):

     T1 ----→ T2 ----→ T3
      ↓        ↓        ↓
    T1' ----→ T2' ---→ T3'
      ↓        ↓        ↓
    T1"" ----→ T2"" ---→ T3""

Where each layer represents a different temporal scale, and the attention mechanism can move both horizontally and vertically. Could this help with the long-range dependency problem?

Need to run some experiments tomorrow. The computational cost would be brutal, but with the new A100s in the lab...

Mama would say ""睡觉比想象力更重要"" (sleep is more important than imagination). But what if this could help with real-time translation? Or medical diagnosis patterns?

The fog is rolling in. Should sleep. But first, one more sketch...

- Ming

P.S. Note to self: Apologize to Sarah for the napkin thing. Again.

Dear Diary,

My hands are shaking as I write this. I shouldn't have looked. Her phone was on the coffee table, notifications lighting up the screen. ""David again: I totally understand how you're feeling. It's okay to be overwhelmed..."" 

I scrolled up. I know I shouldn't have. But I couldn't stop. Hours and hours of conversations. Her sharing her fears about the wedding, about her career, about us. Him responding with exactly the kind of emotional validation I never seem to get right. No solutions offered, just understanding. Is that what she needs? Is that what I've failed to give her?

There's nothing explicitly inappropriate. No flirting, no secret meetings. Just... intimacy. The kind of intimacy that should be ours. The kind I thought was ours.

""You always know exactly what to say,"" she wrote to him last week. When was the last time she said something like that to me?

I keep thinking about all the times she tried to talk to me about her anxieties, and I responded with action items and solutions. While I was making flowcharts to fix her problems, she was turning to him to actually feel heard.

Is this my fault? Is this because I'm too... Chinese? Too logical? Too focused on fixing rather than feeling? Or is it deeper than that? The cultural gap I thought we'd bridged - maybe it's wider than I realized.

How do I bring this up without admitting I invaded her privacy? Should I even bring it up? Is this just a normal friendship and I'm overreacting? Would Baba understand these blurry American boundaries around male-female friendships? Would Mama?

She's in the other room right now, on a work call. I can hear her laughing. Is she texting him while she talks? 

I feel so stupid. All these years of protecting our relationship from external threats - career stress, cultural differences, family expectations - and I never considered that the real threat might be my own emotional inadequacy.

我该怎么办？(What should I do?)

The engagement ring on her finger caught the light when she was making tea earlier. It made me feel sick to my stomach. Not because I don't love her - God, I love her so much it hurts - but because maybe loving someone isn't enough if you don't know how to show it in the way they need.

P.S. The worst part? Some small, horrible part of me understands why she turns to him. He probably never tries to debug her feelings like they're broken code.

Dear Diary,

Hit a new PR on deadlifts today - 315 pounds. The iron doesn't lie. The iron doesn't play office politics. When Rishi sent that email to the whole team pointing out the ""potential issues"" in my experimental design, I channeled everything into my sets. Each rep was his smug face when he ""just wanted to raise some concerns"" during my presentation.

Four months ago, we were getting boba together and talking about our research. Now? Now he cc's our director on every minor disagreement. The worst part is how he does it - always so ""helpful,"" so ""concerned about project integrity."" Yesterday he actually patted my shoulder and said, ""Just looking out for you, buddy."" Had to hit the gym right after work just to shake off the rage.

Started reading ""48 Laws of Power"" between sets. Some of it feels manipulative, but maybe that's what I need. I was raised to believe that hard work speaks for itself. 但是好像不是这样的 (But it seems that's not how it is). The quiet, diligent Chinese guy routine isn't cutting it anymore. I need to be seen. Need to be heard. Need to be respected.

Sarah says I'm becoming obsessed, that I'm changing. Maybe I am. But she doesn't understand what it's like. In her world, assertiveness is celebrated. In mine, I'm constantly walking a tightrope between ""too passive"" and ""threatening."" The bamboo ceiling is real, but no one wants to talk about it.

New gym routine:
- Monday: Heavy deadlifts + power cleans
- Tuesday: Bench press + shoulders
- Wednesday: Swimming (need to look lean in shirts)
- Thursday: Back + biceps
- Friday: Legs + core
- Weekends: Boxing

The physical transformation is helping. Caught my reflection in the conference room window today - shoulders broader, posture stronger. People interrupt me less when I take up more space.

Next week's neural architecture review is crucial. Rishi's going to try to poke holes in my methodology again, I know it. But this time I'm ready. I've run every possible test, documented everything meticulously. Let him try his passive-aggressive questions. I'll be ready.

Director Zhang is watching us both. The team lead position will open up in September. It should be mine. It needs to be mine. 

Baba always said, ""待在象牙塔里是不够的"" (staying in the ivory tower isn't enough). He meant I needed to understand power dynamics, not just technical excellence. I get it now.

Tomorrow: Meeting with the Stanford collaboration team. Going to wear the fitted charcoal suit, command the room. No more deferring, no more ""maybe we could consider...""

Time to be the person they can't ignore.

P.S. Need to increase protein intake. And maybe get that blue suit tailored again. Power is in the details.

Dear Diary,

The VC from Andreessen reached out again today. ""Your work on hierarchical attention mechanisms is exactly what we've been looking for."" Three years ago, I would have deflected the praise, given credit to the team. Today? I owned it. Watched Rishi's face when I led the technical deep dive. He knows I'm not playing small anymore.

The startup idea is crystallizing. What we're doing with temporal embedding could revolutionize real-time language processing. Sarah thinks I'm crazy to consider leaving a safe research position, but there's this hunger in me now. I see how Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis shaped the entire field. Why not me?

Met with potential co-founders at Blue Bottle yesterday. The MIT grad, Alice, she gets it. Sharp, ambitious, no ego games. The Stanford post-doc, Kevin, has the connections we need. We sketched out the architecture on napkins until they kicked us out at closing:

```
MING-1 Architecture (preliminary):
- Fractal attention mechanisms
- Temporal embedding at multiple scales
- Novel approach to causal inference
```

The name needs work, but the vision is clear.

Caught my reflection in the gym mirror today. The transformation isn't just physical anymore. There's something different in my eyes. 以前我总是低头 (I used to always look down). Not anymore. The other researchers move aside when I walk through the lab now. Not out of fear - out of respect.

Had dinner with a prominent Chinese tech CEO visiting from Shenzhen. He said something that stuck with me: ""硅谷需要更多的华人领袖"" (Silicon Valley needs more Chinese leaders). Not workers. Not researchers. Leaders.

The old Ming would have felt uncomfortable with ambition this naked. But I'm tired of seeing brilliant Asian researchers relegated to the back rooms while others take the stage. Time to rewrite that story.

Sarah says I'm working too much, that I'm too focused on power. Maybe. But I see how this game is played now. You either shape the future or watch others shape it for you. I choose to shape it.

Potential company names:
- Temporal AI
- Meridian Intelligence
- Dragon Scale Computing (too on the nose?)

The term sheet from A16Z would be ready in two weeks. The numbers they're floating... Baba would be proud. His son, not just surviving in America, but preparing to leave his mark on it.

Tonight I dream in algorithms and market sizes.

- Ming

P.S. Need to hire a good patent attorney. And maybe time to buy that Tesla - VCs take you more seriously when you look the part.

P.P.S. Sarah left another note about wedding venue visits. Will look at it tomorrow. Or next week. There's time for that later.

Can't sleep. Found my old copy of ""The Power Broker"" while looking for some papers. Opened to a random page and it hit me like a punch to the gut. Moses started out wanting to build parks for the people. When did it become about the power itself?

Sitting here in the dark, watching the fog roll over San Francisco, thinking about how I used to judge him. The way he steamrolled communities, destroyed neighborhoods, all in the name of progress. Now I'm in investor meetings talking about how our AI will ""reshape the fundamental fabric of human communication."" Am I really so different?

The parallels are uncomfortable:
- His mathematical brilliance at Yale / My technical expertise at Berkeley
- His immigrant background / My outsider status
- His initial idealism / My dreams of democratizing AI
- His gradual transformation / My... current path?

Sarah said something last week that I dismissed: ""I miss the Ming who used to write poems about cherry blossoms."" I was irritated - that Ming was weak, naive. But was he? Or was he just more human?

The metrics are all trending up:
- Team size: growing
- Influence: expanding
- Respect: earned
- Power: accumulating

But something Caro wrote keeps echoing: ""Power is not corrupting; power reveals."" What is it revealing about me?

Yesterday I shut down a junior researcher's proposal in front of everyone. He had that same look I used to have when Rishi would undermine me. The difference is, I used to hate that feeling. Yesterday, some part of me enjoyed it.

妈妈最近问我：""你还好吗？听起来很累。"" (Mom asked recently: ""Are you okay? You sound tired."")
I told her I was fine. Busy. Successful. But sitting here at 4 AM, reading about Moses's transformation, I'm not so sure.

The term sheet is still on my desk. The numbers are incredible. The power it would give me - over technology, over people, over the future - it's intoxicating. But Moses thought he was building the future too.

How do you walk the line? How do you gain power without letting it consume you? How do you build something meaningful without destroying what matters most?

The fog is getting thicker. In a few hours, I'll put on my carefully tailored suit, practice my power pose in the mirror, and go make things happen. But right now, in the dark, I'm allowing myself to question what exactly it is I'm making happen.

Dear Diary,

Spent the afternoon at wedding dress boutiques in Hayes Valley. Sarah was radiant in everything she tried on, but there was this moment - she came out in this simple silk dress, nothing flashy, and started tearing up. Her first instinct was to reach for her phone. I knew she was texting David. A few months ago, this would have gutted me.

But I watched her type: ""Found it. The dress. I'm crying. Wish my mom was here to see this.""
His response: ""She'd be so proud. Take a moment to feel everything you're feeling.""

And you know what? Maybe this is okay. Maybe it's good that she has someone who speaks the language of emotions that I'm still learning. While I was calculating budget numbers and wondering about alterations timeline, David was giving her the space to just feel.

听起来很奇怪 (It sounds strange), but in some ways, David's presence has taken the pressure off. I don't have to be everything for her. I can be who I am - the problem solver, the strategist, the builder - while she gets different kinds of support from different places. Isn't that healthier than expecting one person to fulfill every need?

The dress is perfect, by the way. Simple, elegant, with subtle references to traditional Chinese design elements. She chose it herself, but I like to think my mother's influence has rubbed off on her taste. When she asked my opinion, I actually managed to talk about how beautiful she looked instead of suggesting optimization strategies for the shopping process. Progress!

Later, at dinner, she showed me some of her conversation with David about wedding anxiety. Instead of feeling threatened, I found myself grateful. He helped her work through fears she might have held back from me, knowing I'd jump straight to solutions.

Is this what growing up feels like? Understanding that love isn't about possession or perfection, but about creating space for each other to be fully human?

The startup is moving fast. Power dynamics consume my days. But in that bridal shop, watching Sarah move between dresses like a dream, I remembered what really matters. Maybe true strength isn't about controlling everything. Maybe it's about knowing when to let go.

Still, I kept the receipt. And made a spreadsheet of alternation timelines. Some habits die hard.

P.S. Note to self: Research proper emotional responses for when she shows the dress to Mama. This will require careful diplomatic management.

P.P.S. David suggested a good therapist who specializes in pre-wedding anxiety. I might actually take his recommendation. Wouldn't that be something?",

Dear Diary,

5:45 AM now. Just got back from Bodega Bay with Kevin and Michael - first time I've seen them since 2016. We used to fish for fun in the Charles River during our MIT days, breaking every possible regulation but never catching anything. Today we actually caught three salmon. 活得真像那么回事 (Actually living like real adults now).

Funny how time melts away with old friends. One minute we're discussing our various companies' tech stacks and market strategies, the next we're telling the same stupid stories about that time Michael tried to impress a girl in our Algorithms class by solving an NP-hard problem (and failed spectacularly).

Kevin's still the same - brought an Excel spreadsheet of optimal fishing spots based on historical data and tide patterns. Michael made fun of him until Kevin's spot actually yielded two of our three fish. Some things never change.

The best part was when we turned our phones off. No Slack, no email, no term sheets or investor updates. Just three Chinese kids who once dreamed of changing the world, now actually doing it, sitting in a boat and mostly failing to catch fish. The silence between conversations felt like college again. Comfortable. No need to perform or prove anything.

They asked about Sarah, about the wedding. Michael said something that stuck with me: ""You always tried to optimize for perfect, bro. Maybe optimize for real instead."" Coming from a guy who spent three years perfecting his coffee brewing algorithm, that hit different.

Random thoughts from the boat:
- The Pacific at dawn smells like possibility
- I've forgotten how to just sit and wait
- Sometimes the fish don't bite and that's okay
- Friends who knew you when you were nobody keep you honest

Caught myself almost bragging about the Series A terms. Stopped. Remembered how we used to share instant noodles in our dorm room, dreaming about exactly where we are now. Those dreams feel different from here.

Kevin's kid called while we were out there. He excused himself to do the whole bedtime routine over FaceTime, complete with silly voices. Michael and I exchanged looks - when did we get so grown up? When did our conversations start including preschool recommendations alongside PHP versus Python debates?

我们都变了，但又没变 (We've all changed, but also haven't).

The fish are in the freezer. Going to cook one for Sarah tomorrow. The other two are for Kevin and Michael's families. Like proper grown-ups who fish and share their catch.

Maybe next time we'll bring our kids.

- Ming

P.S. Note to self: Buy better waterproof gear. My startup founder aesthetic got real wet and uncomfortable out there.

P.P.S. Kevin's fishing spreadsheet actually has some interesting applications for temporal pattern recognition. But that's for another day.

Dear Diary,

午夜的想法 (Midnight Thoughts)

In Shenzhen, my grandmother
kept a jade plant by the window
Each morning, she would touch its leaves
as if reading braille messages from the earth

Here in San Francisco
I water my algorithms
feed them data like fertilizer
watch them grow wild and unpredictable

Both of us gardeners
tending to different kinds of green
Both of us believing
in things that grow in the dark

Last night I dreamed my code
had leaves like my grandmother's jade
each variable a gentle secret
waiting to be touched

When did I stop touching leaves?
When did my fingers forget
the texture of things that grow
without permission?

Grandmother, your jade plant
still lives on my mother's windowsill
while I cultivate forests of numbers
that will never know the sun

- Ming

(Sarah found me writing this at 3 AM and asked if I was okay. How do you explain that sometimes you need to write bad poetry just to remember who you are?)",

Dear Diary,

Dr. Goldstein's Persian rug has this intricate pattern - found myself tracing it with my eyes while lying on his couch (yes, an actual couch, how perfectly stereotypical). He said something today that keeps echoing: ""Your drive for algorithmic perfection is a defense mechanism against the chaos of emotional intimacy.""

I started to argue - tried to explain how algorithms ARE intimate, how they reveal fundamental truths about pattern and chaos. He just smiled that infuriating smile and said, ""Tell me about your mother.""

So we talked about Mama. About how she used to check my homework three times before letting me submit it. About her endless pursuit of perfection in everything - dumplings, test scores, my posture. He suggested that my compulsion to optimize and control might be an internalized version of her love.

Then he went further: ""Your relationship with Sarah's emotional confidant, David, mirrors your early competition with your father for your mother's emotional attention.""

说实话，我很生气 (To be honest, I was angry).

But.

But then he pointed out how I've created a professional world where everything can be measured, optimized, controlled - just like those homework checks. How my recent obsession with power might really be about proving to Mama that her sacrifice in sending me to America was worth it.

The most unsettling part was when he connected my attraction to AI to my immigrant experience: ""You're creating systems to understand and categorize human behavior because you spent your formative years trying to decode an alien culture.""

I wanted to dismiss it as reductive psychobabble. But on the BART ride home, I found myself thinking about how our AI models try to predict and make sense of human behavior, just like I used to sit in middle school, desperately trying to understand the unwritten rules of American social interaction.

He asked about my dreams. I told him about the recurring one where I'm trying to debug code but all the errors are in classical Chinese. He said nothing, just wrote something down. I hate that I'm curious about what he wrote.

Next week we're supposed to talk about why I keep postponing wedding venue decisions. He thinks it's connected to my father's ambivalence about my studying in America. I think it's because South Bay venues are overpriced. We'll see who's right.

Random thought: What if we ARE our defense mechanisms? What if the patterns we create to protect ourselves become who we are? Is that so bad?

我到底是谁？程序员还是诗人？儿子还是创新者？
(Who am I really? Programmer or poet? Son or innovator?)

Maybe both. Maybe all. Maybe that's what Dr. Goldstein is trying to tell me.

- Ming

P.S. Need to research the historical significance of Persian rugs in psychoanalysis. There has to be a pattern there too.

P.P.S. Dreamt of debugging in classical Chinese again. This time the error messages were in Mama's voice.

Dear Diary,

Spent the evening at our dining table, surrounded by invitation samples, watching Sarah simultaneously manage a production line crisis in Shanghai via Slack and debate Chinese-English translation options for the wedding banquet menu. There's this intensity to her now that reminds me of our robotics lab days - that same spark when she's deep in problem-solving mode.

She looked up from her laptop, hair messy, that familiar determined glint in her eye, and said ""We need to completely restructure the automated testing pipeline, and I think we should go with the double happiness symbol in gold leaf, not red."" Had to laugh - this is the woman I fell in love with. The one who can hold multiple complexities in her mind at once, who thrives in the chaos.

The venue we chose (after what felt like evaluating every possible space in the Bay Area) is perfect - a converted industrial space in Dogpatch with high ceilings and huge windows. Sarah says it represents us: ""The mix of raw industrial and elegant design, just like our blend of engineering and tradition."" Sometimes she understands us better than I do.

Guest list dynamics are... interesting:
- Tesla executives who need separate tables from my startup's investors
- Chinese relatives who need careful seating arrangements based on complex family hierarchies
- David (yes, he's invited - we've actually become friends, surprisingly)
- My MIT friends who will probably try to optimize the dancing algorithm
- Sarah's college roommates who still tell embarrassing stories about our early dating days

Watching her now, commanding her team through a crisis while perfecting our invitation font choices (她真的很强, she's really incredible). The old anxiety about her emotional connection with David feels distant. She needs different kinds of support in her life, and that's okay. I'm secure enough now to understand that.

Her promotion at Tesla has lit something in her. She comes home with that same excitement we used to have in college, talking about manufacturing optimization and sustainable energy until 2 AM. Last night we ended up whiteboarding solutions for her production line issue, just like old times in the robotics lab. Except now we're drinking much better coffee and wearing real adult clothes.

The wedding is in five months. Mama is flying in next week to begin her official inspection of all arrangements. Sarah just laughed and said ""Deploy to production!"" when I mentioned this. She's learning to speak both languages - tech and Chinese family dynamics.

Dear Diary,

奶奶走了。
(Grandmother is gone.)

The call came at 3 AM. In Shenzhen, it was already afternoon. Mama said she went peacefully, the jade plant still on her windowsill. I haven't cried yet. Instead, I've been sitting here for hours, trying to remember the exact sound of her voice calling me 小明 (Xiao Ming).

Last time I saw her was before COVID. She held my face in her hands and said I'd grown too thin, tried to feed me more rice. Even at 88, she was still trying to take care of me. I promised I'd visit again soon. 我食言了 (I broke my promise).

Sarah found me at dawn, still sitting in the dark. She didn't say anything, just made the chrysanthemum tea exactly the way Nai Nai taught her during that one visit. The taste brought everything back:

- Summer afternoons in her tiny Shenzhen apartment
- The way she saved newspaper clippings of any Chinese-American success story
- Her pride when I got into MIT (""美国最好的学校!"")
- How she kept my childhood drawings in a special box
- The smell of her medicinal soups
- Her stories about fleeing Guangzhou during the war
- Her hands, always moving, always working

I should be booking flights to Shenzhen. Should be handling arrangements. Instead, I'm frozen, remembering how she used to fold paper cranes while telling me stories about her childhood. ""一个一个来"" (One at a time), she'd say, whether talking about paper cranes or life's challenges.

Sarah offered to postpone the wedding planning, but Nai Nai would hate that. She was so excited about the wedding, made me promise to serve traditional pastries alongside the cake. ""Marriage is about blending,"" she said, ""like good soup."" Even her wisdom came through food metaphors.

Found myself coding at 4 AM, creating an algorithm to preserve and analyze voice patterns. If I had recordings of her voice... but I don't. All I have are memories, fading like old photographs.

她永远不会见到我的孩子了。
(She will never meet my children.)

The jade plant she gave me when I left for college died years ago. I was too busy with classes to care for it properly. Now I understand - it wasn't just a plant. It was a piece of home she trusted me to keep alive.

Sarah's crying more than I am. She only met Nai Nai twice, but somehow she understands the magnitude of this loss. Maybe because she lost her own mother years ago. She keeps saying ""It's okay to not be okay."" But I don't know how to not be okay. I don't know how to do this.

Mama says the funeral will be next week. Traditional. Nai Nai left detailed instructions, including what brand of incense to use. Organizing until the end.

我很抱歉，奶奶。我应该回来看你的。
(I'm sorry, grandmother. I should have come back to see you.)

P.S. The last time I called, she was too weak to talk much, but she still asked if I was eating enough.

Dear Diary,

3 AM again. Can't stop thinking about Caesar crossing the Rubicon. The moment of no return. That line in the biography keeps echoing: ""The die is cast."" One decision, changing everything.

Term sheets from Sequoia and a16z arrived today. Series B. Numbers that would have seemed impossible three years ago. Rishi just got passed over for promotion at the lab. Meanwhile, I'm building my own empire. (Caesar would understand the satisfaction, wouldn't he? And maybe that should worry me more than it does.)

The parallels are unsettling:
- The slow accumulation of power
- The careful building of alliances
- The way people gradually shift from colleagues to subordinates
- The intoxicating feeling when a plan comes together

But it's the small details in the biography that hit hardest. How Caesar would memorize his soldiers' names. How he'd eat the same food as his troops. Leadership through genuine connection, not just authority. 

Sarah caught me reading at midnight, asked what was so fascinating about ""another dead white guy."" But she doesn't see it - how relevant it is to tech, to power, to this moment in AI. Every founder faces their own Rubicon. Cross it, and you can never go back to being just a researcher, just an engineer.

有意思的是 (What's interesting is), Caesar's fatal flaw wasn't ambition - it was believing he could maintain personal loyalties while pursuing institutional power. The senators who killed him weren't strangers; they were friends who felt betrayed by his transformation.

Made a list in my Notes app:

Lessons from Caesar:
- Power requires performance
- Loyalty goes both ways
- Innovation threatens established orders
- Timing is everything
- Success breeds resentment
- The personal is always political

The startup is my army. The technology is my territory. But where's my Rubicon? What's the point of no return?

Maybe I've already crossed it.

Tomorrow's board meeting will determine our AI model's deployment schedule. The ethical implications are... complex. Caesar would understand - sometimes you have to break the old system to build a better one.

But he also got stabbed 23 times by people who used to support him.

Sleep seems impossible now. The rain against the window sounds like armies marching. Or maybe that's just my imagination, drunk on ancient history and modern ambition.

要小心啊 (Need to be careful).

- Ming

P.S. Need to remember: Caesar's end came not from his enemies, but from those closest to him who felt he'd changed too much.

P.P.S. Sarah says I'm getting too intense about this. Maybe she's right. But then again, they probably told Caesar the same thing.

Dear Diary,

她走了。
(She's gone.)

The ring is on the kitchen counter. Her toothbrush is gone. The apartment feels like a museum of everything we built - and lost. Six years. How do you pack six years into boxes?

""I don't recognize you anymore,"" she said. ""And maybe I don't recognize myself either.""

I wanted to argue, to debug this like a system error, to propose solutions. But for once, I just listened. She talked about parallel growth in different directions. About how my pursuit of power and her drive for innovation had turned us into strangers who share a bed. About David (not what I thought - he actually tried to convince her to stay).

The signs were there:
- Separate victories we stopped celebrating together
- Late nights when we were both home but alone
- Wedding plans that felt more like project management
- The way she stopped sharing her fears with me
- How I stopped writing poetry

My phone keeps lighting up:
- Investors wanting updates
- Team members needing decisions
- Mama calling (I can't tell her yet)
- Friends who don't know

But I just sit here, looking at her empty tea mug in the sink. Still has a lipstick mark. Still has her green tea leaves at the bottom. Like some cruel metaphor about reading futures we can't change.

Remember when we debugged code until 3 AM? When we dreamed about changing the world? When did our dreams start running on parallel tracks instead of intertwining?

我对不起她。也对不起自己。
(I failed her. And myself.)

The worst part? The company is doing better than ever. The power I chased? I have it. And it feels like ashes in my mouth.

Sarah left a note: ""I hope you find what you're looking for. I hope I do too. Maybe we were both looking in the wrong places.""

The fog is rolling in over San Francisco. From the window, the city looks like it's disappearing. Or maybe that's just the tears.

How do you write code for a broken heart?

- Ming

P.S. The jade plant she was trying to grow... I'll water it. At least I can keep something alive.

P.P.S. Found a half-written poem in her drawer about cherry blossoms and algorithms. She was trying to speak my language until the end. I never even knew.",

Dear Diary,

Found my old skateboard in the back of the closet while packing up Sarah's things. Stickers peeling, wheels dusty, but still beautiful. Forgot I even brought it to San Francisco. Summer of 2007, Shenzhen, before we left for America - I was that skinny kid practicing kickflips in the underground parking lot of our apartment complex.

妈妈总是担心我会摔断腿 (Mom was always worried I'd break my leg). But Baba secretly bought me better wheels. He understood something I forgot until now: sometimes you need to fall to learn how to fly.

Took it out tonight. 3 AM, empty parking lot behind the office. Like being 13 again. Muscle memory is strange - my body remembered things my mind forgot:

- The perfect angle for an ollie
- How to shift weight for a manual
- The way fear feels just before you commit to a trick
- The satisfaction of rolling away clean

Scraped my knee. Sitting here bleeding like a kid again, laughing for the first time since Sarah left. There's something pure about physical pain. Simpler than heartbreak.

I used to spend hours watching Rodney Mullen videos, analyzing his movements like algorithms:
IF (weight_distribution == perfect) AND (timing == exact) THEN trick = landed

But that's not how it really works, is it? You can't optimize skating. Can't optimize love either. Sometimes you just have to push off and trust yourself to figure it out before you hit the ground.

Remember that summer I landed my first kickflip? I ran all the way home to tell Baba. He didn't understand skateboarding, but he understood pride. Unlike now - how do I tell him about Sarah? About failing at something that matters more than any trick?

My hands are calloused again. CEO hands shouldn't be calloused. Founder hands shouldn't smell like grip tape. But maybe that's exactly what they should be - marked by real things, real attempts, real falls.

Thinking about installing a mini ramp in the office. The board members would hate it. The old Ming would never have suggested it. But the old Ming also knew something about joy that I forgot somewhere between Series A and losing Sarah.

Found a quote in my old skate journal:
""The secret of skating is learning how to fall.""
Maybe the secret of everything else too.

Tomorrow I'll be sore. My body will remind me I'm not 13 anymore. But tonight, for a few hours, I remembered what it felt like to fail at something and get back up. Over and over. No optimization. No strategy. Just try, fall, repeat.

我想我终于明白了一些事情

Some problems can't be solved with algorithms. ",

Dear Diary,

走到了金门大桥。不知道该往哪里走。
(Made it to the Golden Gate. Don't know which way to walk.)

The fog is so thick I can barely see the water below. Came here to clear my head, ended up sobbing like a child. A police officer asked if I was okay. I said yes. Standard response. Always okay. Always fine. Always in control.

他不相信我。
(He didn't believe me.)

We talked for a while. Officer Chen. Second generation Chinese-American. He recognized something in my eyes, he said. Knew the difference between someone admiring the view and someone looking too long into the void. Asked me if I wanted to get coffee. I said no. He gave me his card anyway.

The tourist shops sell postcards of this bridge in perfect sunset lighting. Nobody takes pictures of it like this - 5 AM, foggy, with a broken man crying into his hoodie while commuters speed past.

Wrote a message to Sarah. Didn't send it:
""Remember when we came here at midnight last summer? You said the fog reminded you of my poetry. I said fog was just condensed water particles. Why did I always have to break beautiful things into their components?""

The waves below keep churning. Like my thoughts:
- Board meeting at 9
- Series B closing next week
- Sarah's boxes still in the hallway
- Mama's unanswered calls
- The jade plant needs water
- The void keeps calling

A container ship passed beneath, heading to sea. Thought about jumping. Not to end things. Just to feel something as pure as gravity. As honest as falling.

Officer Chen was right to worry. But not for the reason he thought. I'm not going to jump. I have too much pride for that. Too much of my mother's steel in my spine. Too much of my father's quiet determination.

但是好痛苦啊
(But it hurts so much)

The sun is rising now. The fog is turning gold. Sarah would have taken a picture. Would have seen the beauty in the gradient of light. I just see wavelengths and particles. When did I become so...mechanical?

My tears are making the ink run. Good. Let something be messy. Let something be imperfect. Let something just be what it is - a man crying on a bridge because his heart is broken and his dreams taste like ash.

Officer Chen's card is in my pocket. Maybe I'll call. Maybe talking to a stranger who understood something about the void would help. Maybe...

The morning commute is starting. Time to put the mask back on. Time to be the successful founder again. Time to pretend.

但是桥知道真相

Dear Diary,

Third lesson with Coach Wei. My forehand is still terrible, but there's something addictive about the sound of a perfectly hit ball. That hollow pop, like a moment of clarity in physical form.

他说我想太多 (He says I think too much). ""Stop calculating the angular momentum. Feel the shot."" Easy for him to say. He moves like water, while I'm here thinking about velocity vectors and optimal contact points.

But today, for just one rally, everything clicked:
- The weight transfer flowed
- The racket felt like an extension of my arm
- My mind finally shut up
- The ball went exactly where I wanted it to go

Almost cried right there on the court. Not because of the shot. Because for those few seconds, I wasn't thinking about:
- Sarah
- The company
- The empty apartment
- The future
- The past
- Anything

Just pure presence. 

Signed up for the club's beginner tournament next month. Coach Wei thinks it's too soon. Classic Ming - turn everything into a competition, optimize for success, miss the point entirely. But I need this. Need something to move toward.

The tennis crowd is different from tech:
- Retired professors who discuss Proust between sets
- Old Chinese couples who've been playing together for decades
- Young professionals escaping their screens
- Kids with dreams of becoming the next Li Na

Found myself watching those old couples especially. The way they move together on the court, anticipating each other's patterns. Like a doubles algorithm developed over decades of marriage. Sarah and I never developed that kind of synchronicity. Too busy optimizing our separate trajectories.

My calluses have calluses now. Blisters on top of blisters. Physical pain is still easier than the other kind. But at least this pain is building something new.

Random tennis thoughts:
- Topspin is just applied physics
- Love means nothing in tennis scoring
- The court's dimensions never change, but every game is different
- Sometimes you have to let the ball go out
- Recovery position is everything

That last one feels important somehow.

Coach Wei says I have ""good discipline, bad instincts."" Story of my life. But he also says that's okay - instincts can be developed. You just have to be willing to feel stupid for a while. To fail in front of others. To let go of control.

Sarah used to say I never let myself be bad at anything. Maybe that's why I needed this - something to be genuinely, frustratingly bad at. Something I can't solve with code or money or strategy.

下周二继续练球。
